## A Data QA System using LangChain Applied to Apiculture in Brazil


This project provides a question-answering (QA) system for apiculture (beekeeping) data using the Langchain framework and OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The system processes PDF documents containing apiculture data, creates embeddings, and uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to answer user questions based on the provided documents. Additionally, a Streamlit interface allows users to interact with the QA system easily.
